The classified data csv has been produced by using PSNR similarity and k=3. 

In order to run the script, you can use the following line:

	python am_i_the_baddie.py "P3_classified_data.csv" "P3_attribute_data.csv"

Please make sure you are using Python 3.8 (at least).

DISCLAIMER:
Normally, this kind of analysis would be performed on much larger sets, so that the results are reliable and representative.

Smaller sets are used in this case only to make manual investigation that this portfolio may require a bit easier. In the future, please use bigger ones!
